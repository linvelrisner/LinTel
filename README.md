# LinTel
A personal site based off of teletext (My first name + "tel")

Teletext was an old way of receiving breaking news from news stations. Most of this shut down in the 2010s, but while researching I found this cool website that made this website possible.
https://galax.xyz/ is the website of Alan Davies, the genius behind this design that I have repurposed. He's a stylish man, and anything you might need you should head on over to galax.xyz and make some inquiries. 

I also added a news ticker, and heavily modified the template provided by Alan Davies.
